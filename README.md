# deforestation_rainfall_correlation
The aim of this project is to check if there is any correlation of rainfall with deforestation in Pennsylvania.

The rainfall data is taken from https://climate.met.psu.edu/data/state/yravgprecip.php?division=7

The deforestation data is taken from https://www.globalforestwatch.org/dashboards/country/USA/39/?map=eyJjYW5Cb3VuZCI6dHJ1ZX0%3D

The data of rainfall was linearly fitted with deforestation and surprisingly, a negative correlation of 0.72 was found.
